# Drone Delivery Simulation System, University Project

Worked on in a team of 2: Avi Rosenbaum, Chaim Fishman

## System Summary
This system simulates a system of drones to deliver items to customers. To run, run the PL(Presentation Layer) package.
The first screen just has a button to manager, it would be possible to add functionality just for users in the future.

Once clicking on manager, the system will allow you to see the current lists of Drones, Stations, Customers and Packages. You can add more with the buttons on the right. To start a simulation, click on the drone lists and select a specific drone by double clicking on it. You can then start the simulation in which the drone will automatically complete tasks such as delivering available packages in the system or returning to the nearest station to charge if the drone is low in battery. The drone's information will be updated as the system is run. 

## Project Meta Details
This project was done using C# and .NET. It uses the 3 layers architecture of Data Access Layer (DAL), Business Layer (BL) and Presentation Layer (PL) and the packages are named as such to seperate appropriately. The project was also used to practice Object Oriented programming.
